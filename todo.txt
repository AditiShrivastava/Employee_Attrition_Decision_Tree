PART-2
1.We have to deal with both numerical and categorical attribute.So i will be categorising the attributes into two types.
2.For catergorical , use the previous function of PART 1.
3.For numerical,make a function that will divide each unique value of each attribute into different ranges(LHS <=num && RHS >num)
4.for LHS,calculate entropy and for RHS as well.Calculate the weighted average of both.
5.Repeat 4 for all the unique values of the attribute and find the maximum gain among them.
6.Find maximum among all the numeraical attributes and return it as the maximum among numerical attributes
7.Find maximum among all the categorical attributes
8.Find the maximum among both and return it as the root node.
9.Eliminate that attribute from the dataframe and repeat till 8 for the rest.
